\section{Reflection}


This report looks holistically at the threat landscape and cyber-security teams in an organisation following on from points raised by HBR report. 

Looking in depth a one element of cyber-security defences, produced in the case study, the breadth of the topic I would need to summarise, as
background became apparent.  Also, the difficulty of providing a review of end-point cyber-protection also became apparent. 
  
Overall, making this a higher-level discussion on the benefits of resilience over protection made a better topic for this unit, and I am happy
with where the report is pitched and think I have achieved that objective. 

What I have not been so successful in is encapsulating the technical knowledge of Windows process injection and detect methods needed to
support the case study and present that in a way that is congruent with the higher-level focus of the overall report.

On balance, I believe I have achieved the stated aims of the report and that the technical details correct.  For this I would expect a distinction grade.
