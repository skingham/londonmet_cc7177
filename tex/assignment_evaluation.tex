\section{Evaluation}


When doing this, the breadth of the topic I would need to summarise became apparent. 

Also, the difficulty of providing cyber-protection also became apparent. 
  

Because of this I pivoted to looking more holistically at the threat landscape and cyber-security teams in an organisation after reading  the HBR report. 

Overall, making this a higher-level discussion on the benefits of resilience over protection made a better topic for this unit, and I am happy with the rewrite and think I have achieved that objective. 

What I have not been so successful in is encapsulating the technical knowledge of Windows process injection and detect methods needed to support the case study and present that in a way that is congruent with the higher-level focus of the overall report.
