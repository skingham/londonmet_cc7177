\title{Can Mockingjay Evade your CISO: A Review of Current Process Injection Attacks}
\author{Stuart Kingham}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  CISOs and boards are not commuicating well with divergent views on the risk of cyber-attacks.
  CISOs should regularly be asking their information security teams to perform risk assessments and mitigation reports that can be used to
  communicate to senior executives and boards on the specific threats to an organisation. 
  In this report we ask if modern End-point Detection Systems (EDR) can provide blanket protection from attacks and what a CISO should be asking from
  their vendors and how attacks can be mitigated.  We review process injection attacks and perform a deep dive review of a modern Windows attack.  We
  ask how well EDRs are able to thwart attacks and highlight the risks of an attack evading an Endpoint Detection System.
